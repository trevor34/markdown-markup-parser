# markdown-website-builder
This is a website builder that uses Nodejs and [Markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it).

Currently, it just parses markdown using markdown-it, but it would be nice to add more in the future, such as making new files and having all the markdown text in one file.
