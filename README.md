# markdown-website-builder
This is a website builder that uses Javascript, jQuery, and (Markdown-it)[https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it].

Currently, it just parses markdown using the markdown-it repo, but it would be nice to add more in the future, such as making new files and having all the markdown text in one file.
